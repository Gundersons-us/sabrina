My husband and I have been trying to buy a house. It's stressful and we feel like the scum of the earth because we’re not swimming in money and simply can’t compete with bids that go $50-$100K over listing price. We feel poor as we watch houses we love sell at a price much higher than appraised value, for cash and with no contingencies. Apparently we’re getting reamed by investors in other countries who have piles of cash and are happy to turn around and rent these properties for $3000/mo. Ouch. All we can do is try to be ready to move quick and schedule tours within a day or two of listing and hope it doesn’t go into a bidding war if the sellers decide to review all offers on a specific date. Which brings me to what I wanted to share…

In hopes of actually finding a home before I’m of retirement age, I get instant notifications from the Redfin app and emails from a number of Real Estate agencies. Last night I noticed I had gone a full 3.5 hours(!) without a single notification, which seemed odd. Also, no emails at all. None. Not even from, like, Old Navy. I thought for a moment that my gmail wasn’t working so I sent my husband an email to see if he would receive it and if I would get a response.

Sent email text: "This is a test"

I literally shot snot OUT OF MY NOSE.

Let this be a lesson to everyone out there–even when you’re stressed and hate yourself for not being able to do the one thing you set out to accomplish and your husband is STILL working after 9pm and isn’t pleased about it, testicles will always be funny. Always.
