# Moosh
I spend time each week looking over old and new recipes, make a grocery list and plan weekly menu. I'm careful to rotate through fish, pork, poultry, red meat and vegetarian meals so I don't get bored of anything. I make a spreadsheet with my planned meals for each day as well as a grocery list. I take extra special care to group meals that have similar ingredients so that if Monday calls for half an onion I manage to use the other half shortly thereafter.

However, I tend to spend half my Saturday doing this.

Once I get my database of meals I like put together, I won't have to troll Pinterest for recipes (as much). I'm looking forward to being able to quickly search my own recipes for a meal using a specific ingredient, a noted prep time and a side that cooks at the same temperature for a similar amount of time. Yes, I know I'm crazy. I think I've learned to embrace it.

Given that I put a ridiculous amount of time and effort into my meal planning, I was shocked to find myself without all the ingredients needed for the dinner I had planned for the evening. Namely, I didn't have the stuff for saffron rice. Since I change into my PJs as soon as I get home from work, I wasn't about to put on _real_ pants and go to the store!

Pinterest to the rescue! I was able to find a recipe I had marked to try where I had all the ingredients on hand (or a close approximate). Luckily, I found something quick to prep, as I was neck deep in trying to make my own breadcrumbs to sprinkle over the mahi mahi in homemade tarter sauce I had scheduled for dinner.

I decided to make a warmed dijon potato salad. Easy. Except I didn't have red potatoes so I just ran with some russets. Which I cut into small pieces since they were so huge. Seriously, what's with the monster veggies at the store? I swear I just saw a yellow onion bigger than my head...

The breadcrumbs did not go well. Not at all. I blame gluten-free bread. Once I figure out how to make crumbs instead of bread jerky, I'll let you know.  Anyway, I failed to start the timer on the potatoes while futzing with the bread. By the time the mahi mahi was sprinkled with tiny hand-shredded pieces of bread-jerky and in the oven, I turned back to VERY overcooked potatoes.

They were so done that they mashed themselves when I drained the water from the pot. Crap.

[This](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/228116/warm-dijon-potato-salad/ "Warm Dijon Potato Salad recipe") is what I was aiming for:

The following is what actually occured--the altered recipe that started this blog

~~Mash Mush~~ Moosh!

Here's the skinny with the Moosh:

### Ingredients:

* 2 large russet potatoes
* 1/2 cup low-fat mayo
* 4 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese
* 4 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
* 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
* 1/2 large yellow onion
* 2 green onions
* Salt and pepper to taste
* And the star player here: 2 cups shredded red cabbage

### Directions:

1. Cut potatoes into eighths and place in a pot. Cover with water and add some salt if desired.
      * If trying to avoid the mashed texture, cut into quarters instead and reduce heat to medium after boil.
2. Bring water and potatoes to a boil. Cover and continue to boil for 15 minutes.
3. While boiling potatoes, combine the mayo, vinegar and chili powder in a bowl.
4. Drain potatoes and add to the bowl containing the mixed ingredients. Add onions and mash until uniform in texture. 
5. Add in cabbage and stir to mix. Top with cheese and serve. 

I realized from the get go that I was going to be missing a key texture since I over-boiled my potatoes. So, I decided there needed to be some kind of crunch. I looked to see what I could throw in and found a half of a head of cabbage that needed to be used anyway. While not the prettiest meal I ever made, I am certain I averted disaster by throwing in the cabbage.

What kind of mishaps have you had in the kitchen? Did you recover or was it a loss?

I concur that it was not only edible, it was actually quite good. :)
