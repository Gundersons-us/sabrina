I've been toying with the idea of writing a blog for a long time. I started one recently and pretty promptly let it die. It was meant to be a food blog aimed at sharing some easy and delicious recipes. But, as I can't be bothered to measure out anything I use and don't feel like buying a fancy camera and becoming a food photographer, it was not meant to be. Oh well.

As I sit here and procrastinate things I should be doing (folding the laundry that's been piled on the guest bed since, I dunno, mid-2014) I've been checking out facebook and reading random blogs. Two things I have noticed: 1) nothing on facebook seems real–everything for everyone is perfect excepting a few funny anecdotes about someone's kid that's really more of a story about what an adorable and precocious child they have, and 2) some blogs are really honest and funny–even about those moments in life that really just go awry or get away from you. I prefer the picture of life presented by the blogs.

So, I've just decided, this blog is just going to be about my day (or week, or month, or how ever often I decide to post) and the random thoughts that go through my head. Maybe some serious, probably a lot that's not, but mostly just my thoughts run amok.

Allow me to welcome you into my own personal circus.
