I&#8217;ve been toying with the idea of writing a blog for a long time. I started one recently and pretty promptly let it die. It was meant to be a food blog aimed at sharing some easy and delicious recipes. But, as I can&#8217;t be bothered to measure out anything I use and don&#8217;t feel like buying a fancy camera and becoming a food photographer, it was not meant to be. Oh well.

As I sit here and procrastinate things I should be doing (folding the laundry that&#8217;s been piled on the guest bed since, I dunno, mid-2014) I&#8217;ve been checking out facebook and reading random blogs. Two things I have noticed: 1) nothing on facebook seems real&#8211;everything for everyone is perfect excepting a few funny anecdotes about someone&#8217;s kid that&#8217;s really more of a story about what an adorable and precocious child they have, and 2) some blogs are really honest and funny&#8211;even about those moments in life that really just go awry or get away from you. I prefer the picture of life presented by the blogs.

So, I&#8217;ve just decided, this blog is just going to be about my day (or week, or month, or how ever often I decide to post) and the random thoughts that go through my head. Maybe some serious, probably a lot that&#8217;s not, but mostly just my thoughts run amok.

Allow me to welcome you into my own personal circus.
